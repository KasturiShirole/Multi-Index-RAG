# Multi-Index-RAG

The advanced technique that queries multiple vector databases simultaneously for richer, multi-domain answers. 

Tech Stack:
LangChain -> RAG orchestration 
ChromaDB -> multiple vector databases
Nomic-embed-text-v1.5 -> embeddings 
Groq API -> Free open LLMs 
Python + Google Colab + Hugging Face 

Why Multi-Index RAG better than Single-Index? 
Traditional RAG has one index, one perspective.
Multi-Index RAG has multiple domain-optimized indexes (AI, ML, NLP, etc) that collaborate for deeper, domain-aware answers.
1. Domain Specialization
2. Parallel Retreival
3. Comprephensive Context
4. +40 % Accuracy & Completeness

Real-world Use cases:
Medical Research -> merge clinical trials, patient data, drug knowlegde
Finance -> integrate market data, company filings, reports 
Enterprise -> unify docs, wikipedias, internal systems 
Multi-domain AI Assistants -> handle diverse knowledge areas
